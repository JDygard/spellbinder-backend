Combo system:
We're going to start on the combo system now.
A combo is a sequence of word lengths that, when executed without interruption, will result in a combo attack.

    Define Combo data structure: Create a data structure to represent combos, including combo name, sequence of word lengths, time limit, and the effect or bonus that the combo provides.

    Create Combo list: Define a list of available combos in the game. This will make it easy to add or modify combos in the future.

    Track player input: Modify the game to keep track of the player's input, including the word lengths and the time each word was submitted. You may need to create a data structure to store this information.

    Combo detection: Implement a function that detects whether a combo has been executed by comparing the player's input sequence with the combo list. If a combo is detected, apply the combo effect to the player.

    Combo timer: Implement a timer that checks if the player has submitted the required words within the time limit. If the player fails to complete the combo within the time limit, reset the combo tracking data.

    Combo UI: Update the user interface to display the active combo, the progress towards completing the combo, and any combo effects applied.

    Combo effect execution: Implement the logic to apply the combo effects to the player, such as increasing damage, healing, or applying special abilities.

    Add new combos: Create a simple way to add new combos to the game by updating the combo list and implementing the corresponding combo effects.
